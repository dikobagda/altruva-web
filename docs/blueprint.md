## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A sophisticated dusty rose (#824123) to evoke feelings of luxury and serenity. This is slightly desaturated from the original brand color, which was too strong to work with in a larger palette.
- Background color: Very light pink (#F1dbdc) creates a soft, inviting backdrop.
- Accent color: A muted lavender (#b76631) provides a delicate contrast, ensuring key elements stand out without clashing with the primary color.
- Elegant serif font (Libre Baskerville) for headings to convey sophistication and trustworthiness.
- Clean, light sans-serif font (Nunito Sans Light) for body text to ensure readability and a modern touch.
- Use minimalist line icons to represent services and features, maintaining a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Employ a spacious layout with ample white space to enhance visual clarity and create a sense of calm.
- Incorporate subtle, elegant animations, such as fade-ins and transitions, to enhance user engagement without being distracting.
